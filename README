This module contains several tools for easing script output:

- `osplitter`, an output stream splitter
- `writecounter`, counts the number of write calls

The output stream splitter (`osplitter`)
========================================

When generating data from a typical simulation script, one usually
wants the output redirected into several places. A common use case is
to print log messages both to `stderr` and a file. The `osplitter`
class can be used as a drop-in replacement for streams like the
sys.stderr, with output redirected to several places by registering
different steam objects with the `osplitter`. In the following
example, log messages are output both to a temporary file and to
sys.stderr:

    >>> import sys, tempfile
    >>> import outils
    >>> outfile = tempfile.TemporaryFile()
    >>> ostream = outils.osplitter(outfile, sys.stdout)
    >>> print >>ostream, 'Logged message'
    Logged message
    >>> outfile.seek(0)
    >>> outfile.read()
    'Logged message\n'
    >>>

The write counter (`writecounter`)
==================================

This class implements a writer which simply counts the number of write
operations. This can for example be used in conjunction for polling
the progress of the data processing from a separate thread.
